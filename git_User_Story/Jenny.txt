(merge)
As a developer
I can work with others without overlapping files. For example, I edit a file in the project while my teamate is editing the same file.
When we merge our works together, we'll get some warnings to choose one of these or keep both files.<conflicts>

As a developer
I can work on my own works without waiting others finish their hold works, then we'll merge together after whoever finish the works.

use cases:
  - 

(branch)
As a developer
When my project has a lot of features to do and I have to develop a new feature, I don't want my teamates able to edit my files.
I can finish my works on my local computer(seperate with other features), it'll protect my works from other features troubles.

(issue)
As a developer
I can note about what I have to do or what I have to fix. For example, before I do my project, I have to make some to do list 
and when I finish the task, I can check as done. Sometimes after I run testing file, it'll have some errors, I want some places
to mark this, then I won't forget what I have to do and I can estimate the time to finish my works.

(insight)
As a developer
I can know my teamates branch actions such as, merge which branch into which branch, what's date that they create the branch, or
the branch is sub branch of which branch.

(reset)
As a developer
I can reset my work to any steps of my commits.
