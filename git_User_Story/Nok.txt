<<< Story 3 >>>
User Story:
    As a developer,
        I can show the feature that I think it's good for a project to other developers,
        so that the project may have better version.

Use cases:
    - Developer X fork the project.
    - Developer X create branch for the feature.
    - Developer X add and commit work to Git.
    - Developer X push branch and work.
    - Developer X open pull request.
    - Developer Y merge the request to master branch.
        - If the system reports conflict, the Developer Y notify the Developer X to
            resolve the conflict and push edited work and let Developer Y merge again.
        - If there's no conflict reported by the system, the Developer Y merge the
            feature to the master branch.
