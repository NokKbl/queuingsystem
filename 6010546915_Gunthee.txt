As an owner
I can check that customer will come in how many minutes left. I don't want to serve a melted ice-cream to customer. 
For example, there is 1 customer in the first queue, but he come in 20 minutes. 
If I prepare this order now, it'll melt before customer come in.

1) The product shall have a text area to fill the time that customers want to get their orders.
2) The product shall calculate how many minutes left that customer will come in by using their location, distance, and speed.
   Then, show this time in the order's details. 
3) The product shall has notification when customer is near the store.
